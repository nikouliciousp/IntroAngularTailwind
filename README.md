## Project Description

This Angular application includes the following parts:

### 1. **Introduction Page**

The first page of the application welcomes the user and explains the project's purpose. It includes the following:

- **Application Title**: Dynamically rendered using the `title` property in Angular.
- **Introduction**: Describes the core objectives of the project, such as learning the basics of Angular, exploring Angular components, and understanding dependency injection through services.

### 2. **Creating Components**

The application contains the following custom components:

- **`app-my-hello`**: A component that likely displays a greeting message.
- **`app-event-bind`**: A component for demonstrating event binding in Angular.
- **`app-two-way-bind`**: A component showcasing two-way data binding in Angular.
- **`app-structural-directives`**: A component for demonstrating Angular structural directives (e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`).

### 3. **Using Structural Directives**

The application explains how to use structural directives like:

- `*ngIf`: For conditionally displaying or hiding elements.
- `*ngFor`: For looping through a list or array of data.

## Application Features

- **Introduction to Angular**: Explains the basic features of Angular, including components, data binding, and structural directives.
- **Event Binding**: Demonstrates how to bind events to methods in Angular.
- **Two-way Data Binding**: Shows how to create a two-way data binding between the component and the view.

## Usage Tips

1. **Customizing the Title**: You can customize the `title` property in the TypeScript file, and it will automatically update in the page.
   
2. **Interacting with Components**: Explore how the components interact with data and properties, and how they react to user input.
